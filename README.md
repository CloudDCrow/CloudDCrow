- 👋 Hi, I’m @CloudDCrow
 
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. I love music, playing guitar brings me a lot of relaxation and there is nothing better
than to listen to some LOFI music while coding.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code and draw. I am currently a Computer Science student and would like to learn as much about
coding as possible. It is hard to find enough time while balancing life and schoolwork, but I'll try my hardest!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can learn something from. The only thing I am currently after is knowledge.

- 📫 How to reach me - Through GitHub
