- 👋 Hello, my name is Rok.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. I love music, playing guitar brings me a lot of relaxation. I also enjoy tons of
different sports, my favorite being football and basketball. I occasionally play video games as well, my favorite being the
latest Zelda game, Breath Of The Wild.

- 🌱 Right now I am learning to code and draw. I am currently a Computer Science student, and would like to learn as much about
coding as possible. It is hard to find enough time while balancing life and schoolwork, but I'll try my hardest!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, that I can learn something from. The only thing I am currently after is experience.

- 📫 How to reach me - Through GitHub
